# Data Science Projects
This repository contains a collection of data science projects developed using Python. Projects demonstrate various techniques and skills in data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization, image manipulation and training prediction models. These projects highlight practical applications in data science, including data cleaning, file processing, model training for prediction and visual analytics.

Tech Stack: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn.

# Contents
- File Processing: Project working with files in Python.
- Image Manipulation: Image manipulation using Numpy.
- Data Cleaning: Project focused on cleaning and preprocessing datasets to prepare them for analysis.
- Data Storytelling: This project showcases the application of visualization, clustering, regression, and other analytical methods to uncover actionable insights and craft data-driven narratives.
- House Price Prediction: Training different models to predict house prices and analyzing impact of different locational features
- Customer Churn Prediction: Checking the correlation between customer churn and different numerical values. Training logistic, Random Forest and XGBoost models and comparing model performances using ROC curves, accuracy, precision and recall.
- Credit Risk Assessment: Implementing Decision Trees using Gini and Entropy, comparing them by calculating accuracy, node impurities and information gain. Choosing the best model by trying out different parameters, handling class imbalance and analyzing confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1-score, ROC curve and AUC score of decision tree model.
