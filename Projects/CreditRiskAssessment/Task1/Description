Labeling the Components:
    * Root Node:
        - Credit Score >= 600
            This is the starting point of the tree and divides the dataset into two broad categories:
            customers with acceptable credit scores and those with lower credit scores.

    * Internal Nodes:
        - annual_income >= 40,000
            This node further refines the group of customers with low credit scores, assessing their
            financial stability based on income.

        - Employment Duration >= 4
            This node evaluates customers with acceptable credit scores based on their job stability.

        - existing_debt >= 5,000
            This node assesses customers' financial obligations relative to their income.

    * Leaf Nodes:
        - Low Risk: Represents customers who are financially stable and likely to repay the loan.
        - Medium Risk: Indicates moderate credit risk due to one or more concerning factors
            (e.g., shorter employment duration or higher existing debt).
        - High Risk: Represents customers with significant risk factors such as low income, high debt,
            or poor credit scores.

    * Branches:
        Each edge (arrow) connecting the nodes represents a decision or split based on the criteria at
        the parent node (e.g., Credit Score >= 600 is either True or False).


Splitting Criteria Explanation
    * Credit Score >= 600:
        Credit score is a primary indicator of creditworthiness, reflecting customers' financial behavior and
        risk of default.
        Criteria: Splits customers into those with a good credit score (True) and those with a lower score (False).

    * annual_income >= 40,000:
        Income determines the ability to handle existing and new financial obligations.
        Criteria: Distinguishes between low-income customers who may struggle to repay loans and higher-income
        customers who are financially stable.

    * Employment Duration >= 2:
        Job stability often correlates with financial reliability, with longer employment duration
        indicating stable income.
        Criteria: Divides customers into those with secure jobs (True) and those with unstable employment (False).

    * existing_debt >= 5,000:
        High levels of existing debt increase financial pressure and risk of default.
        Criteria: Differentiates customers with manageable debt (False) from those with potentially
        unmanageable debt (True).
