# Image Processing Project

# Overview
This project provides a set of functions to manipulate images using Python. The operations include rotating, adjusting brightness, cropping, and performing mathematical operations on images. The manipulated images are saved in a specified directory.

# Features

* Rotate Image: Rotate an image by 90, 180, and 270 degrees counterclockwise.
* Adjust Brightness: Increase or decrease the brightness of an image by a specified factor.
* Crop Center: Crop the central portion of an image (50% of its original area).
* Mathematical Operations: Compute the mean, max, min, and sum of pixel values in an image.
